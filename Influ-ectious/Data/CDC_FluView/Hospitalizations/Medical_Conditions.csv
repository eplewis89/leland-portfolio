"The Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) data are preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. The denominator for each underlying condition is the total number of patients with non-missing data for that condition."
"Asthma includes a medical diagnosis of asthma or reactive airway disease."
"Autoimmune conditions include rheumatologic and inflammatory conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis, polyarteritis nodosum, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and vasculitis."
"Cardiovascular disease includes conditions such as coronary artery disease, cardiac valve disorders, arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension. This category excludes people who have hypertension only."
"Chronic lung disease excludes asthma, and includes conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiolitis obliterans, cystic fibrosis, interstitial lung disease and obstructive sleep apnea. "
"Gastrointestinal/liver disease includes conditions such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis."
"Hypertension includes a medical diagnosis of hypertension. "
"Immune suppression includes conditions such as HIV/AIDS, complement deficiency, immunoglobulin deficiency, leukemia, lymphoma, solid organ malignancy, and individuals taking immunosuppressive medications."
"Metabolic disease includes conditions such as diabetes mellitus, adrenal disorders, and thyroid dysfunction."
"Neurologic diseases include conditions such as seizure disorders, cerebral palsy, cognitive dysfunction, multiple sclerosis, and muscular dystrophy."
"Obesity is assigned if body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m2, or if BMI is missing, if a diagnosis of obesity is indicated in a patient's medial chart."
"Pregnancy percentage is calculated prior to the 2022-2023 season using the number of female cases aged between 15 and 44 years of age as the denominator. Staring with the 2022-2023 season, pregnancy percentage is calculated using the number of female cases aged between 15 and 49 years of age as the denominator."
"Renal disease includes conditions such as chronic kidney diseases/chronic renal insufficiency, nephrotic syndrome, glomerulonephritis, and end state renal disease. "
"Other condition includes blood disorders, pediatric conditions not captured by other categories, feeding tube-dependent, trach or vent-dependent, and wheelchair dependent, as well as other conditions not captured by other existing categories. "
"No known condition indicates that the case did not have any known underlying medical condition indicated in the medical chart at the time of hospitalization."
"Underlying medical conditions of pregnant women are included when 'Adults' and/or 'Pediatrics' is selected."
