Disclaimer:
The Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) data are preliminary and subject
"to change as more data become available. In particular, case counts and rates for recent hospital"
"admissions are subject to reporting delays. As data are received each week, prior case counts and"
rates are updated accordingly. FluSurv-NET conducts population-based surveillance for
laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations in children <18 years of age and adults.
"The FluSurv-NET catchment area includes selected counties in California, Colorado, Connecticut,"
"Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, and Utah."
"Additional counties in Idaho (2010 to 2011), Iowa (2012 to 2013, 2020-2022), Oklahoma (2010 to"
"2011), and Rhode Island (2010 to 2013) have also contributed to the network. Incidence rates (per"
"100,000 population) are calculated using the National Center for Health Statistics' (NCHS) vintage"
bridged-race postcensal population estimates for the counties included in the surveillance
catchment area. The rates provided are likely to be underestimated as influenza-associated
hospitalizations might be missed due to test availability and provider or facility testing
"practices. In all influenza seasons except 2009-10 and 2021-22, rates reflect cases hospitalized"
during October 1 - April 30 of each influenza season. Cases hospitalized during MMWR Week 39 are
"included in the totals for MMWR Week 40, while cases hospitalized during MMWR Week 18 are included"
"in the totals for MMWR Week 17. In 2009-10, rates reflect cases hospitalized during Sept 1 2009"
"through April 30 2010 (MMWR Week 35 - MMWR Week 17). In 2021-22, rates reflect cases hospitalized"
"beginning October 1 2021 (MMWR Week 39), but given late influenza season activity, the season was"
"extended to June 11, 2022 (MMWR Week 23)."
